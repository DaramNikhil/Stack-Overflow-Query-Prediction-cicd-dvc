4186249	1	Searching and capturing a character using regular expressions Python <p>While going through one of the problems in <a href="http://www.pythonchallenge.com/" rel="nofollow">Python Challenge</a>, I am trying to solve it as follows:</p>  <p>Read the input in a text file with characters as follows:</p>  <pre><code>DQheAbsaMLjTmAOKmNsLziVMenFxQdATQIjItwtyCHyeMwQTNxbbLXWZnGmDqHhXnLHfEyvzxMhSXzd BEBaxeaPgQPttvqRvxHPEOUtIsttPDeeuGFgmDkKQcEYjuSuiGROGfYpzkQgvcCDBKrcYwHFlvPzDMEk MyuPxvGtgSvWgrybKOnbEGhqHUXHhnyjFwSfTfaiWtAOMBZEScsOSumwPssjCPlLbLsPIGffDLpZzMKz jarrjufhgxdrzywWosrblPRasvRUpZLaUbtDHGZQtvZOvHeVSTBHpitDllUljVvWrwvhpnVzeWVYhMPs kMVcdeHzFZxTWocGvaKhhcnozRSbWsIEhpeNfJaRjLwWCvKfTLhuVsJczIYFPCyrOJxOPkXhVuCqCUgE luwLBCmqPwDvUPuBRrJZhfEXHXSBvljqJVVfEGRUWRSHPeKUJCpMpIsrV....... </code></pre>  <p>What I need is to go through this text file and pick all lower case letters that are enclosed by only three upper-case letters on each side.</p>  <p>The python script that I wrote to do the above is as follows:</p>  <pre><code>import re  pattern = re.compile("[a-z][A-Z]{3}([a-z])[A-Z]{3}[a-z]") f = open('/Users/Dev/Sometext.txt','r') for line in f:     result = pattern.search(line)     if result:        print result.groups()   f.close() </code></pre>  <p>The above given script, instead of returning the capture(list of lower case characters), returns all the text blocks that meets the regular expression criteria, like</p>  <pre><code>aXCSdFGHj vCDFeTYHa nHJUiKJHo ......... ......... </code></pre>  <p>Can somebody tell me what exactly I am doing wrong here? And instead of looping through the entire file, is there an alternate way to run the regular expression search on the entire file?</p>  <p>Thanks</p>
54312	0	 <p>Yes, of course there is :-) object oriented techniques are a tool ... if you use the wrong tool for a given job, you will be over complicating things (think spoon when all you need is a knife).</p>  <p>To me, I judge "how much" by the size and scope of the project.  If it is a small project, sometimes it does add too much complexity.  If the project is large, you will still be taking on this complexity, but it will pay for itself in ease of maintainability, extensibility, etc.</p>

3289313	0	 <p>Assuming that's VB.Net, you need to escape the <code>)</code>:</p>  <pre><code>If Regex.IsMatch(Output, "\b" &amp; "Serial\)" &amp; "\b") Then     'do something End If </code></pre>  <p>In .Net regular expressions, parentheses are the grouping characters.</p>  <hr>  <p>If, as you say, the word 'Serial)' is generated dynamically, you will have to <a href="http://msdn.microsoft.com/en-us/library/system.text.regularexpressions.regex.escape.aspx" rel="nofollow noreferrer">escape</a> it before passing it to the RE engine:</p>  <pre><code>If Regex.IsMatch(Output, "\b" &amp; Regex.Escape("Serial)") &amp; "\b") Then     'do something End If </code></pre>  <hr>  <p>As one other answerer has posted, this won't match <code>"Serial) xyz"</code> (for example) since there's no <code>\b</code> between the <code>)</code> and space (<code>\b</code> only exists <em>between</em> <code>\w</code> and <code>\W</code> characters and both <code>)</code> and a space are <code>\W</code>).</p>  <p>You may have to resort to an ugly hack like:</p>  <pre><code>If Regex.IsMatch(Output, "\s" &amp; Regex.Escape("Serial)") &amp; "\s") _ Or Regex.IsMatch(Output, "\s" &amp; Regex.Escape("Serial)") &amp; "$") _ Or Regex.IsMatch(Output, "^" &amp; Regex.Escape("Serial)") &amp; "\s") _ Or Regex.IsMatch(Output, "^" &amp; Regex.Escape("Serial)") &amp; "$") _ Then     'do something End If </code></pre>  <p>I thought that maybe you could match a character class consisting of (<code>^</code> or <code>$</code>) and <code>\s</code> along the lines of:</p>  <pre><code>If Regex.IsMatch(Output, "[\s^]" &amp; Regex.Escape("Serial)") &amp; "[\s$]") Then     'do something End If </code></pre>  <p>but this doesn't appear to work based on the regex tester <a href="http://regexlib.com/RETester.aspx" rel="nofollow noreferrer">here</a> so you may have to go for the ugly hack version or you could combine them into a single regex as in:</p>  <pre><code>var input = "Serial)" var escaped = Regex.Escape (input) var regex = "\s" &amp; escaped &amp; "\s|^" &amp; escaped &amp; "$|\s" &amp; escaped &amp; "$|^" &amp; escaped &amp; "\s" If Regex.IsMatch(Output, regex) Then     'do something End If </code></pre>

Remember that the configurable product needs to be set to in stock and the associated simple products have to have at least one item with non-zero inventory and be set as 'in stock'.</p>

8978532	0	NSView subclass over another NSView subclass? <p>I'm trying to create an Cocoa-AppleScript Application with some basic functions, and I want to display a background image for the window and then display a color box above it. </p>  <p>I finally figured out how to set the background image via this guide (<a href="http://www.mere-mortal-software.com/blog/details.php?d=2007-01-08" rel="nofollow noreferrer">http://www.mere-mortal-software.com/blog/details.php?d=2007-01-08</a>), but I don't know how to set a color box above it. The basic layout I'm trying to achieve is this:</p>  <p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/o25EI.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>  <p>The window view has a class of <code>ViewBackground</code> which is a subclass of <code>NSView</code>. The <code>ViewBackground.m</code> file looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>-(void)drawRect:(NSRect)rect {     NSImage *anImage = [NSImage imageNamed:@"repeat"];     [[NSColor colorWithPatternImage:anImage] set];     NSRectFill([self bounds]); } </code></pre>  <p>Like I said, that works fine. The problem is when I try to put the box with the background color white above it. I thought I would be able to do this by making a new subclass of <code>NSView</code>, <code>ContentBackground</code>. The <code>ContentBackground.m</code> file looks like this:</p>  <pre><code>-(void)drawRect:(NSRect)rect {     [[NSColor whiteColor] set];     NSRectFill(rect); } </code></pre>  <p>The hierarchy of my windows looks like this:</p>  <p><img src="https://i.stack.imgur.com/PzF0I.png" alt="enter image description here"></p>  <p>Now this <em>sometimes</em> works, but usually produces this result in the debugger:</p>  <pre><code>int main(int argc, char *argv[]) {     [[NSBundle mainBundle] loadAppleScriptObjectiveCScripts];     return NSApplicationMain(argc, (const char **)argv);            Thread 1: Stopped at breakpoint 1 } </code></pre>  <p>What am I doing wrong and how can I fix this?</p>  <p>Also, the content (buttons, etc..) will go on top of the <code>ContentBackground</code> box.</p>
21300539	0	 <p>Reading your comments, i see that it is not a ZF2 error, and probably not even a third party module, so it could be an ElFinder Error. Probably it cannot find some required resources.</p>  <p>Reading some code and some webdites, i think that probably you are just lacking the url option of the viewhelper, so ElFinder can find the backend route he tries to connect to. </p>  <p>With the QuElFinder, the route to the connector is  <code>/quelfinder/connector</code>  so in your view, the code will be:</p>  <pre><code>echo $this-&gt;QuElFinder('elfinder', array(     'width' =&gt; "50%",     'height' =&gt; '300',     'url' =&gt; '/quelfinder/connector'     ) ); </code></pre>  <p>Also, you should go to <code>QuElFinder/config/module.config.php</code> and check everything under </p>  <pre><code> 'QuConfig'=&gt;array(         'QuElFinder'=&gt;array( </code></pre>  <p>because as you can see in the QuElFinder controller, in the <code>connectorAction()</code> function, it is reading that configuration, and there is a lot of paths.</p>

3532484	0	 <p>Your replace statement should be a regex string. <code>$</code> indicates the end of a line in regex, to find a dollar sign you need to escape each one with a <code>\</code> so your regex should be <code>\$</code> for each one you want to match.</p>  <p>for the rest, just use CSS</p>

34941141	0	 <p>finally figure out the answer, add a custom TypedJsonString class,</p>  <pre><code>public class TypedJsonString extends TypedString {     public TypedJsonString(String body) {         super(body);     }      @Override public String mimeType() {         return "application/json";     } } </code></pre>  <p>convert my json object to TypedJsonString,</p>  <pre><code>TypedJsonString typedJsonString = new TypedJsonString(jsonObject.toString()); </code></pre>  <p>changed the api class as follows,</p>  <pre><code>Observable&lt;Item&gt; getListOfFeed(@Body TypedJsonString typedJsonString); </code></pre>
